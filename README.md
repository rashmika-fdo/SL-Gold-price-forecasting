![Gold Price Trend](gold forecast.jpg)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project models and forecasts **daily gold prices** in Sri Lanka during the economic crisis (**April 2022 – November 2024**) using **time series analysis**. The goal is to predict price movements and provide insights for **investors, policymakers, and financial institutions**.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **ARIMA(0,1,1)** was selected as the best ARIMA model after testing various (p,d,q) combinations.
- **ARCH(2)** was applied to address volatility effects, but lacked a perfect fit.
- **GARCH(1,1)** was found to be the optimal model, achieving the lowest error (**MAPE: 0.6579%**).

## 📊 Key Findings
✅ **ARIMA(0,1,1)** effectively modeled the trend but had volatility issues.

✅ **GARCH(1,1)** captured market fluctuations, providing accurate forecasts.

✅ Forecasting gold prices in volatile periods is crucial for **banks, traders, and policymakers**.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Explore **Hybrid models, Machine Learning, and LSTM** for better predictive performance.
